A try to create an java application which syncs the timing of starting of audio clip and starts them at the same time.
Application works on calibration of delays on server and client machine which is not perfect for cross os machines.
Interface developed from ground up and dedicated hardware required for implementation of such idea.
Complex structure.

CDC         :   Calculated Delay Calibration Library
Connector   :   Connector for TestClient   
Converter   :   Required functions for convertsion and calculations
playSync    :   Main server library
TestClient  :   Main client library
testPlayer  :   Audio player library
